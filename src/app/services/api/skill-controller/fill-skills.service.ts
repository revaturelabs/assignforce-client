  So this one's a doozy. 
  
  This service can be used to populate objs. This is done by first getting the 
  list of skills, and then getting the list of objects. These are both done 
  through observabes, and then a filter is run to replace skill arrays that only 
  have skill ids to skill arrays with all information included.

  serviceType takes in the type of service to use
  callback allows the user to add custom functionality

  You can utilize this service like this:

    this.isLoading = true;
    this.fillSkills.setList("trainer", () => {
      this.isLoading = this.fillSkills.isLoading;
      // custom functionality here sets the trainers array with what has been put
      // into objs in this service
      this.trainers = this.fillSkills.objs;
    })

  I'm really sorry if this is a little too complicated. I tried separating everything
  into separate functions so that it's a little more readable.
